/**
     * Stack is a class
     * Queue is not a class. It's an interface
     * The Queue interface has two important methods that all classes that implement the Queue interface must implement:
     *       1. add(E element)
     *       2. poll()
     * Dequeus: a type of queues. It's a double-ended queue, meaning that you can add or remove elements from either end 
     * of a dequeu (front or end)
     * 
     * Dequeus offer also these methods:
     *      1. addFirst(E element)
     *      2. addLast(E element)
     *      3. pollFirst()
     *      4. pollLast()
     * The most popular class that implements that Queue interface is LinkedList
